          <p class="blog-post-meta">October 2024 <a href="about.html">by Soline</a></p>

          <p>Last year with my sister Ivanne I went to Gumla and visited many villages in the region to meet the teams, the
          villagers and to witness the progress of the project.
          This was a fantastic experience and I am glad to report to you that the people are very enthusiastic as they
          experience the direct benefits of Mahila Shanti. You can find below news regarding the project's progress on
          the 5 pillars.</p>

          <p>Father Arvind who works as well on the project, sent me this message for you: "We are very glad to extend our
          gratitude and sincere thanks to you for your help for the project of Mahila Shanti in the year 2021 and 2022.
          The villagers and especially the women and teenage girls are very happy and express their gratitude to all who
          supported."
          <p>Gram Utthan is the name of the organisation in Gumla.</p>

          <p>Here is an update regarding the 5 objectives of Mahila Shanti - they are very positive !</p>
          <em>Result 1 </em>
          <p>100% the 650 adolescent girls in the project villages attend the weekly class and are aware of their health
          needs. The rules of hygiene are understood and put into practice.</p>

          <em>Result 2 </em>
          <p>45 of the 90 trained health promoters are active and able to make diagnoses (fever, malaria, low and high
          blood pressure, colds, snakebite injuries, etc.), suggest treatments and refer those with unknown or more
          serious symptoms to hospital. Their regular exchanges and monthly reports have led to a steady reduction in
          illnesses and mortality rates in the villages and improved access to medicines, resulting in a visible
          improvement in health standards. Cases of malaria are reduced from 60% also with the increased use of mosquito
          nets. 50% of medicinal herbs come from villagers' gardens and the forest.</p>

          <em>Result 3 </em>
          <p>The 65 registered women have been trained and are now active midwives: they have established links of trust in
          the various villages. They regularly visit pregnant women and help them to get their regular control at the
          hospital. Their advice on pre- and post-natal care has led to a marked improvement in the health of mothers
          and babies.</p>

          <em>Result 4 </em>
          <p>The 37 dispensaries are visited regularly and share information on the health problems encountered in the
          region. The trimonthly contact with public hospitals and local authorities supports the ongoing training and
          ensures vitamin supplies.</p>

          <em>Result 5 </em>
          <p>100% of the nurses attend the meetings and gain confidence: they share the situations they came across to find
          solutions together. 80% of medicine stocks are supplied and stocks of medicinal plants are maintained,
          including the organisation of seasonal plants. 80% of the population trusts the nurses' advice and treatment.</p>
          
          <h2 class="blog-post-title">Newsletter #2</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">November 2022 <a href="about.html">by Soline</a></p>

          <p>In February 2022, the project started following the monsoon and the wedding seasons. While my uncle Marc
            was very enthusiastic about the project, he unfortunately passed away at its very beginning. When I talked
            to him over the phone some days before, he was at peace, ready to leave, very thankful and full of
            encouragement.</p>

          <p>A lot happened and the results of Mahila Shanti are extremely positive. The villagers that were trained (or
            still in training), are active and organizing their regular meetings and reports, and people are committed
            to the project and to their missions to improve their quality of life. See below for their feedback.</p>

          Here is a message from Sister Anna who took over the project: "On behalf of the operation team and the
          <p> village people of Gram Uthan I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude. Yours and all those who have
            donated with quick actions reveal your great love towards the humanity. Please convey our gratitude to all
            who are one with you to support Gram Uthan activities."
            Gram Uthan is the name of the organisation in Gumla.</p>

          <em>Result 1 </em>
          <p>Out of 650 adolescent girls in these villages; 70% are attending to the weekly class and 50% know their
            health requirements.</p>

          <em>Result 2 </em>
          <p>Out of 90 trained village health promoters, 20 are already active and working with monthly reports. The
            measures they put in place led to a drastic reduction of the sicknesses and of the death rate in the
            villages; a better access to medication, farming medicinal herbs and preserving herbal plants from the
            forest.</p>

          <em>Result 3</em>
          <p>Out of 60 women who plan to follow the classes; 15 are already fully trained as midwives and meet families
            of expecting mothers to counsel them on pre and postnatal care of the mother and the child, visiting
            regularly and bringing them to the hospital for their checkups.</p>

          <em>Result 4</em>
          <p>Out of 37 dispensaries; 25 are regularly meeting in the network to discuss local health problems.</p>

          <em>Result 5</em>
          <p>100% of the nurses attend the meetings and 50% now share openly about their problems. 80% of stock of
            medicine are supplied. 80% of the people trust the advice and treatment of the nurses.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Newsletter #1</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">September 2021 <a href="about.html">by Soline</a></p>

            <p>My uncle Marc wrote below message as he wanted to truly thank each one of you who participated to the
              funding of the project 1st year:</p>
            <em>
              <p>My gratitude is very great, because you have so much generosity, and as for me I am on the spot and
                know the people well. Many, many personally. They need to earn by themselves, not gifts in money but
                trainings so that all are healthy and work well. Again, organized in groups to ensure the continuity of
                this beautiful work. The women of the villages are taught to meet every week and think about the
                improvement of the village. This is a brand-new idea because before each one for himself, divided into
                tribes and castes was the norm.</p>

              <p>This project MAHILA SHANTI = Peace to the Ladies, takes progress through health. Mrs. Harriet Toppo is
                a very capable nurse and director. She goes to the villages and teaches. Today she is in Katkahi, a
                large parish of over a hundred years old and encourages a lot of villages to be faithful to their
                meeting every week. It changes the whole village... The VHP's = Village Health Promoters, will only
                start in February like every year, when the rice is stored, when New Year’s Eve and the January weddings
                are over. Now this first year is assured. </p>
              <p>So thank you very, very much. Because we still have a lot of projects, especially for the "character
                formations" that the traditional ones cherish. As for the Christians, they are already better organized.
              </p>
              <p>All this concerns hundreds of villages (hamlets), something like 500 catholic villages, and 300
                traditional villages, because well-tempered ideas spread quickly.</p>
              <p>Kind regards, and very affectionately, </p>
              <p>Marc</p>
            </em>

            <hr>
            <p>And here is the news I received from him: </p>
            <em>
              <p>Many things have already begun, but few that are from Mahila Shanti. We must wait for the lockdowns to
                decrease. </p>
              <p>To start the realization of the first year of the project, we need a lockdown relax. This does not seem
                to be happening any time soon. But in any case, the big execution will be started in February 2022,
                after the rice harvest and the wedding season. It is in these months (from February on) that we will do
                all the training courses, because then people are free to come to Gumla. I do hope that the lockdown
                will be lifted. </p>
              <p>These days we work like clockwork with a few days of training in the villages. I only go to the office
                on Monday mornings. Although our staff keeps visiting the villages. I will send you some pictures. I'm
                so glad you were able to collect all this. I am currently reporting on our activities for the years
                2016-2019 on the same plan as Mahila Shanti, the results are absolutely excellent (Hardly anything in
                2020 and 2021 because of the containment). Hundreds of villages are cleaner, drink clean water, take
                care of the sick, put expecting mothers in the hospital etc... Malaria has decreased a lot, diarrhea
                too. Tuberculosis patients are well cared for and cured. Oh, what a great job. </p>
              <p>The monsoon lasts from mid-June to mid-September. But sometimes it lasts several weeks more.</p>
              <p>This year it started very early and it often rains. When it rains even if gently, nobody goes out. For
                the rest of the day the weather is nice, and moreover we did not have heat this summer. Then life in the
                villages is going on without any problems.</p>
              <p>The big training of Mahila Shanti will be next year from February. Until then, there will be training
                days for teenage girls, as well as visits to the 37 clinics that energize each of the dozens of
                villages. </p>
              <p>The idea of putting the people of the villages in committee works very well, but I must support them by
                visits and inspiration.</p>
